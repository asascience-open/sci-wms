Roadmap
=======

SCI-WMS is funded by a number of organizations to fufill the specific 
needs of the Metorological and Oceanographic community. We are 
committed to ensuring that the project follows a logical and innovative 
path, but due to time and budget constraints some enhancements and 
updates will take precedence over others.

We welcome discussion of problems and suggestions for new features at 
the `SCI-WMS Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sci-wms>`_. 
Enhancements that have been accepted by the team for inclusion into the project can 
be found at the project Github `repository <http://github.com/acrosby/sci-wms/issues?state=open>`_.

The target for Version 1.0.0 is a server that is:

* Well documented
* Easy to install
* Easy to administer
* Stable

Important enhancements in the queue include:

* Better support for unconventional but CF compliant datasets
* `Styles that express uncertainty, like in climate modeling <https://github.com/acrosby/sci-wms/issues/77>`_
* Support for projections in addition to Web Mercator
* `Support for CF Discrete Sampling Geometries <https://github.com/acrosby/sci-wms/issues/65>`_
* `Support for ROMS style staggered grid representations <https://github.com/acrosby/sci-wms/issues/63>`_
* `Support for native SWAN (non UGRID-CF) output <https://github.com/acrosby/sci-wms/issues/62>`_
* `Scripts to automatically add datasets to server from various cataloging systems <https://github.com/acrosby/sci-wms/issues/22>`_
* `Add support for hardware based rendering on machines capable of it <https://github.com/acrosby/sci-wms/issues/15>`_
* Integration with advanced HTML5 browser-based visualization tools
