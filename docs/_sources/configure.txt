Refer to this section if you are setting up SCI-WMS for the first time.

***************
The Admin Site
***************

SCI-WMS comes with an administration site built into the server. 
This allows users to add and remove datasets, as well as setup 
and manage groups. (It is essentially the default Django admin 
interface, but it works well for our purposes.)

The admin page can be found on a running instance at **http://server:port/admin** .

The default username is **sciwmsuser**, and the default password is **sciwmspassword**. 
The first thing you should do after getting your server started is to login into the 
administration utility and change the password for this user, or remove the default user and add your 
own.

.. caution::
    Depending on the version of Django you have installed, you 
    may have a problem logging into the admin site, even with 
    the correct password and username. An easy way to solve this 
    problem is to run the following command in a terminal to reset 
    the *sciwmsuser* password using Django's management functionality::
    
        cd sci-wms/src/pywms && python manage.py changepassword sciwmsuser
