Roadmap
=======

SCI-WMS is funded by a number of organizations to fufill the specific
needs of the atmospheric and oceanographic communities. We are 
committed to ensuring that the project follows a logical and innovative 
path, but due to time and budget constraints some enhancements and 
updates may take precedence over others.

For discussion of problems and suggestions for new features: 
`SCI-WMS GitHub project <https://github.com/sci-wms/sci-wms>`_.

===================
Current (|release|)
===================

We are currently trying to eliminate some of the major bugs, that are within our control to fix. 
We are also trying to firm up the functionality and api components before the release of version 1.0.0.

===============
Version 1.0.0
===============

The target for Version 1.0.0 is a server that is:

* Well documented
* Easy to install
* Easy to administer
* Stable

=============
Version 1.1.0
=============

=============
Version 1.2.0
=============

By this version we would like to see solid support for all 
netCDF/openDAP datasets that can be expressed by CF, 
anything that is not supported will be considered a bug.

================================
Goals not assigned to a version
================================

* `Support for CF Discrete Sampling Geometries`_
* `Support for ROMS style staggered grid representations`_
* `Support for native SWAN (non UGRID-CF) output`_
